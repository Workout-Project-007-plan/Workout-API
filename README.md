# Initial Documentation - Workout API

Welcome to the initial documentation of the Workout API. In this section, we will provide an overview of what the project aims to do and the problem it seeks to address.

## Overview

The **Workout API** is an application designed for fitness enthusiasts who want to have more personalized control over their gym workouts. Often, the workout plans provided by gyms do not cater to the individual needs of each person, and there is a demand for a tool that allows creating, tracking, and adapting workouts efficiently.

## Problem

The problem that **Workout API** aims to solve is the lack of customization and workout tracking in gym environments. Many individuals feel the need to make adjustments to exercises, repetitions, sets, loads, and rest times, but the lack of a dedicated tool often results in an ineffective workout plan. Additionally, many individuals use handwritten notes or generic apps to track their progress, which can be disorganized and impractical.

## Solution

**Workout API** provides a comprehensive solution to these issues. Through this application, users can create personalized workout plans, add specific exercises, determine repetitions, sets, loads, and rest times, and track their progress over time. Furthermore, the app will enable users to make adaptations to their workouts based on their individual needs, resulting in a more effective and rewarding gym experience.

## Target Audience

**Workout API** is intended for individuals who attend gyms and wish to have more personalized control over their workouts. This includes people who do not use gym-provided workout plans and prefer to create their own workout plans tailored to their needs.

This initial documentation offers an overview of the **Workout API** and the problem it aims to address. As we progress in the development of the application, we will add more detailed information about functionalities, architecture, and how users can make the most out of **Workout API**.

If you have any questions or feedback, please do not hesitate to get in touch. We are excited to build a tool that meets your needs and enhances your workout experience.
